She develops a world unlike any others while keeping it firmly in the real world.  This is a very well written and entertaining novel.  I was quite impressed and intrigued by the way that this solid storyline was developed, bringing the readers right into the world of the story.  I was engaged throughout and definitely enjoyed my time spent reading it.I loved the character development in this novel.  Da Silva creates a cast of high school students who actually act like high school students.  I really appreciated the fact that none of them were thrown into situations far beyond their years, nor did they deal with events as if they had decades of life experience under their belts.  It was very refreshing and added to the realism and impact of the novel.  The friendships between the characters in this novel were also truly touching.Overall, this novel was fantastic.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more and to find out what happens next in the series.

It certainly came to me highly recommended. My husband and I read this book along with the companion workbook with 4 other couples, and it was and arduous journey. For our group of Christian couples in happy marriages, there was just too much that did not apply to us. Sure, we each picked up a handy tip here and there, but it wasn't enough considering the length and repetitiveness of this book.I agree with the basis of Eggerichs' main point in this book: If she gets the love she needs, she will give him the respect he needs, which will cause him to give her the love she needs. You get it - it's the cycle of love and respect. I gave it to you in one sentence instead of 24 chapters. If this book was about a third the length, I probably would have rated it at least 1-star higher.Every time our group met after the first time, we felt like we were struggling to get something new out of what we had read. The workbook is even worse. The questions are extremely verbose restatements of what is already written in the chapters, and there are a lot of them. Each couple would need to invest a couple of hours into each session, only to feel like we were trudging through the same material each time.We were also disappointed by the lack of scriptural references. Though the book is loosely based on Ephesians 5, the author rarely includes scripture in the chapters and more often uses letters from happy Love & Respect retreat participants as teaching tools. Our group was hoping for more Biblical discussion than what we got.If your marriage needs work and you and your spouse have trouble supporting each other and understanding each other's point of view, this book may help you.

Despite all the mixed reactions people have had to the New 52, I've been hearing a lot of great things from people I trust about this new take on Wonder Woman. But I was still on the fence so I waited until my library got a copy of the trade. Now after reading I feel like an ass for waiting for so long, because it is awesome.Wonder Woman has always been a blending of mythology and the DC universe, but Azzarello takes it to the next level. While some mythology and DC purists might not like the changes, I loved them. On so many levels.First, the feel of this story has more of a mythological atmosphere. It reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. We're dropped into the story, with a narrative that sounds right out of folk tale and action befitting a flagship title for DC. Yeah, this is a Wonder Woman title, while many people view her as a diplomat and peace keeper, they forget that she is also an Amazonian princess, equal in strength and power to Superman. In this story Diana doesn't hesitate to kicks ass and takes name.The story is compelling, the art is stunning, but above all that, this is a Wonder Woman I can relate to, as well as admire. She is bold, conflicted, and rightfully so. The very foundation of her existence is shaken. Everything about how she viewed herself, and her mother changes in this story, and still Diana stays true to herself and her mission.This is a dark story, lots of bloodshed, death and raw humanity. Which is right up my alley. The supporting cast is great, and diverse in very surprising ways (I LOVE Chaing's take on all the goods, especially Apollo). Gods like Hermes, Apollo and Eris are deeply involved in the story, along with the very human character Zola, who plays a big part in the story. Zola is awesome, she delivers a lot of fantastic lines that made me laugh out loud, but is also very sympathetic. She didn't ask to be thrown into the middle of a godly power struggle, but she does a great job of coping with all it.I also love the look of Diana in this book. Yes, she still has the hour-glass figure of the classic Wonder Woman, but she is taller, and broader. She looks like an Amazon of legend. She also fights like a warrior, gets in the action. Chaing does a fantastic job with action shots, and her design. Giving us enough of the old to keep her familiar, but with a whole new take on everything from her costume, complexion and stature. Paired with Azzarello's fantastic storytelling, we get a great example of a what a reboot can do. This team does it right.I can't recommend this book enough. Even if you've never read comic books, if you like Wonder Woman, mythology, or just stories featuring kick ass women at the helm, you should give this one a try.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A New Take on Wonder Woman, and I love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1398816000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2014"}

This book is a nice antidote to those two extremes because it is at times both funny and insightful in a rueful and self-deprecating way.  By that I mean Ms. Gurwitch knows her way around a one-liner and around an extended goof of a story, (see \"AuDum at the Apple Genius Bar\"), but she also has a handle on wry commentary on the state of the recently 50. The emphasis is on wry commentary - there's no over the top hysteria, no relentless kvetching, no excess. We all get older, and some of the stuff associated with that is funny, or at least can be given a good-humored spin. That's what's going on here, and it is all done with honesty, a keen eye for the absurd, and a grown up appreciation of people and their foibles and preoccupations.

However, she redeemed herself, by bringing MIL for a visit, and then eventually keeping her.If I were describing the novel on a graph, I&#8217;d say it starts ok, then goes down down down, then gradually goes up to a nice level.

Even though I am not quite finished with this book, and still have a few pages remaining, I wanted to go ahead and write the review because I have learned and enjoyed so much during its reading. In fact, as soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to go finish the book.I grew up in a home, church, and social circle that viewed all forms of alcohol as ... well... evil. When it was mentioned that someone was drinking or that someone drank occasionally or socially, it was absolutely appalling. I am not sure how much of this was because of actuality or because of my perceptions of the situations where drinking was encountered, but it was a definite no-no to drink in any way, shape, or form.When I got older, I began encountering people that caused my views to conflict with the reality around me... in other words, I was meeting people who were clearly steadfast Christians, but they would drink occasionally or socially. My worldview didn't allow for this. In fact, many of the drinkers that I met were by far more dedicated to the cause of the gospel than the teetotalers that I had known. So I did what any good Christian would do... I shunned them and ignored these conflicting worldviews. WAIT! NO! I went to the Bible to determine the truth! What I found was quite different than what I had &#34;known&#34; growing up. My views needed adjusting.When I eventually encountered Drinking With Calvin and Luther!: A History of Alcohol in the Church by Jim West, which was a Christmas gift from my wife, my views had shifted appropriately and were fairly solid now on what the Bible actually teaches concerning alcohol, but were still hazy on the practicality of these new views. This book served to solidify those views, and give me direction on how to practically apply those views. It is a very Biblical book, but what was absolutely surprising to me was the actual history of alcohol in the church, which this book does an absolutely amazing job of bringing to light.I have a great respect for church history. I believe that it is important what Christians have believed historically. This is why I am a big supporter of reading and learning from historical documents, creeds, and books. Like Paul writing to Timothy, I am often saying, &#34;Don't forget to bring my scrolls!&#34; (2 Timothy 4:13) ... well for me ... &#34;books!&#34;  I mean, really, who am I, or who are we to believe that the last 2000 years Christians have gotten  it wrong? In fact, tracing the beliefs that have stuck can be extraordinarily enlightening. The amount of historical information and quotes that Jim West shares from remembered and respected Christian leaders through the ages was extraordinary. It never felt cumbersome reading this book, but I did find myself often wanting to quote different portions of this book. Especially those encounters with quotes from Martin Luther, like:&#34;Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and women. Shall we then prohibit and abolish women?&#34;~Martin LutherJim West also confronted the different teachings of the prohibitionist's views by going directly to the scripture. He displayed an amazing knowledge of the topic from the historical, the Biblical, and even the opposing view points. If you are actually interested in learning what the Bible teaches concerning alcohol, then I recommend this book. If you want to learn the Church's historical stance concerning alcohol, then I highly recommend this book.I would like to point out in advance, as a Pastor myself, that there were many members of the clergy, through the ages, that were paid ... not just monetarily, but with kegs of beer for the purpose of entertaining.

I loved this book from beginning to end! One thing I find particularly appealing about Eloisa James is her uncanny ability to describe a person, not just their looks but their feelings as well and in this book she did not disappoint. Her description of India's reaction to a particularly condescending marriage proposal is a case in point, \"Aggravation marched up her spine like a troop of perfectly dressed soldiers.\"Both India and Thorn are strong characters, exceptionally good at what they do and accustomed to being in command, so when they get together sparks fly. A particularly witty exchange of letters early in the book in which neither backs down but both clearly enjoy the correspondence hints at the relationship to come. Despite their strength of character and despite their stubbornness both India and Thorn are vulnerable, largely due to difficult childhoods yet it is those hard starts to life that have shaped them into what they are. It is those vulnerabilities that made me warm to them.I found this book hard to put down. I found myself sneaking a few chapters when I woke in the middle of the night and struggling to stay awake so I could reach the end, yet also wanting to carry on living with the characters, and I guess that's the mark of a good book.

This part I found interesting in part because I know many civil servants and people who live in housing projects.The narrator gets fired from the civil service then works for a famous writer named Osano.  This part of the book is boring.  We don't know much about Osano except that he wants to win the Nobel prize in literature and lives like a pig.  While we don't know what makes Osano a leading figure in US literature but we do know about his numerous personal failings.  This part of the book is bad.The best part of the book is the ending where the narrator goes to Hollywood and to me the book ended with a punch.  Some of the books stories of Hollywood life were excellent.There are some parts of the book that describe the workings of Las Vegas which I also thought was outstanding.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Parts slow and other parts outstanding", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}

So it was natural that I read her latest book. and was pleasantly surprised in the direction in which it took, a departure from pure crime to a more traditional novel. I am told that it is the first in a planed trilogy.It a novel with broad mature understanding that examines bonds people form: those between siblings, child to parents and vice-versa, to friends, comrades in arm, and even with four legged creatures. In this case the animals are primary horses. I know little about horses but my own dogs and cats provides me with a feel  how much a person can love and cherish an animal. However the size of horses adds an element of danger to the relationship as a horse can accidental or intentionally kill a person.The story centers around two families of the horse set, one that breeds and trains horses and the other who has a family business manufacturing transportation equipment for horses. There are a number of lesser characters that cluster around the families. The various threads of  relatioship quickly weave an interesting narrative filled with action and drama that should hold any readers attention.

Every chapter seems to end with some variation of the line, '... and then we'd find the Panther.  And one of us would die.'  And there are 83 chapters.  I thought we were being set up for some alternate ending in which this did not happen, but DeMille is not John LeCarre (thankfully).  But the actual ending isn't all that satisfying.The author takes a shot at fleshing out the bad guy character early on, which was interesting, but then he just drops it and becomes repetitive.  The closer-to-home bad guy is a walking cliche.  John Corey's capacity to just be a plain jackass has grown beyond amusing here, and Kate Mayfield is given almost nothing to do.Almost all the action is packed into the last few chapters, and then, just when things got rolling, a sudden ending that wasn't worth the previous 500+ pages, basically reading about meetings.  The ending seems to leave open the possibility of a sequel, which could pit John Corey against one of his teammates from this book, whom he would secretly want to succeed.  Probably woouldn't be great.If you like this kind of stuff, and have already read the first four John Corey books, read any of the Sean Drummond books by Brian Haig instead.

Luna is witty, tough, proudly dysfunctional in a gleeful sort of way, yet honestly broken, too. And though she's got a lot of Buffy Somers in her - she's not the &#34;Chosen One&#34; with super powers or super strength or resiliency. She knows the demonic because it's haunted her since childhood. She can see demons, she can fight them,  but the only thing she's got up on regular human beings is her knowledge and association with demons, and that's it.The story's pacing is smooth, with easily-consumed, concise chapters, and the story moves right along. Yardley is very confident in telling this story, and making this world seem real.  Also, we get the sense that the supernatural world we're exposed to here is merely a fraction of what's to come, so if you like supernatural mythos/mash-ups like The Dresden Files or Supernatural, this might be a good fit for you, also.Finally, I do want to address the issue of some tense slippage, which I saw someone mention in another review (that ironically misused grammar in its title). There is a little tense slippage, between first person present and first person past. But experienced readers will realize these are merely blips that got overlooked in the editing process, and they in no way detract from the story at all.

Vera heads to work one evening and when she leaves there is snow blanketing the ground and her son is gone.

The pain she went through is something no mother should ever have to go through.

She worked hard to make life as good as she could for her son, and it was so easy to feel the love she had for him.Claire is going through her own heartache.

That is how it is essentially portrayed in the media and the scientific establishment.Author Jonathan Wells, however, is anything but politically correct.  He portrays the debate as a conflict between two views of what is real.  On the one side are the Darwinists, protectors of a materialist creation myth which begins with the words \"in the beginning were the particles in mindless motion.\"  And on the other side are proponents of intelligent design, most of whom would affirm John chapter one, \"in the beginning was the Word.\"Not all I.D. proponents are Christians, but all are open to the possibility that nature may show the hallmarks not only of natural causes but also of intelligent causes.  This is decidedly a politically incorrect point of view, and with examples Wells illustrates the professional cost one may incur for holding it.By citing philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, he shows why the current Darwinian power structure is digging in its heels and refusing to consider evidence that does not comport with its materialist paradigm.  But if Kuhn is right, Wells has reason to be confident that even now we are seeing the beginning of a paradigm shift as the last and strongest bastion of nineteenth-century materialism - Darwinism, crumbles before the growing onslaught of the evidence.

Sometimes he is one of the antagonists and sometimes he is a secretly sentimental.  In Suzan Lauder's debut novel, Alias Thomas Bennet, she places Mr. Bennet in a role he does not often have the good fortune to occupy &#8211; the role of hero!In this novel Mr. Bennet takes more interest and care in his family.  He doesn't make sport of or ignore his wife, and she in turn is a bit more sensible and economical.  He isn't careless with his finances and management of Longbourn, which results in a very comfortable living situation and adequate dowries for his daughters.  When Mr. Darcy comes to town, he finds the Bennets (especially Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth) to be very intelligent and pleasant company.  How do the improved manners and abundance of propriety in the Bennet household effect the illustrious Mr. Darcy of Derbyshire...Is Elizabeth still inferior?  Is marrying her still a degradation?What an originative take on Pride and Prejudice! I enjoyed seeing how the different dynamics of the Bennet family impacted the storyline, and the happy and congenial atmosphere around Longbourn was heartwarming to witness.  Much better than their usual disorder and disfunction!  I enjoyed seeing Mr. Bennet be active in his daughters' lives and take steps to protect them from Wickham.  While at times, I may have thought the Bennet family a little too near &#8220;pictures of perfection,&#8221; I overall enjoyed seeing them portrayed in a more favorable light for a change!What I loved most about this story was that it had a duel plot &#8211; besides the present-day story of Mr. Bingley letting Netherfield Park, readers learn about the traumatic experiences Mr. and Mrs. Bennet faced twenty years ago and how those experiences brought them together through periodic flashbacks.  For me, learning the secrets of their past and witnessing their falling in love was my favorite part of the story.  More so than the Darcy and Elizabeth  storyline!  (I know, how shocking, right?!?)  In fact, I would have loved to see more of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!  Especially Mrs. Bennet &#8211; if Mr. Bennet is this story's hero, I think she should be the heroine. :)Unique and enthralling, Alias Thomas Bennet is a wonderful choice for readers who want to see a different side of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!

The day she leaves her home to find work, she has an unexpected guest. Marco Black, from Nemesis Unlimited, has taken the job of trying to get her fortune back. Nemesis heard about Bronwyn's trouble from her former maid. They normally didn't help the nobility, but they were convinced that Bronwyn was worthy.They soon learn that Bronwyn's late husband's business manager stole the money to cover his gambling debts and travel to Paris to find him. After locating the man, they learn that he owes money to one of France's most ruthless crime syndicates, Les Grillons. Unfortunately, the business manager can't pay back the money he owes and is soon killed. Since Bronwyn and Marco witnessed the murder, they are now on the run from Les Grillons.Marco searches out a former associate of his for help. While running from Les Grillons, Marco and Bronwyn can't fight their attraction to each other and soon become lovers after agreeing that this would be a short affair. But what happens when their feeling start to run much deeper?I LOVED this story. You see bits of Marco in the other books in the series and knowing that he was a spy for England had intrigued me. His story did not disappoint me.Browyn was not your typical society wife. When she lost all her money, she didn't lose it. She had set a plan in motion when Marco swept in to help her find the missing money. Had she been the typical society miss, Marco would have never fallen for her. His background working with Nemesis has given him a dislike of the upper class. It said a lot to Marco that Bronwyn's maid was the one asking for help. She had to be someone special to inspire such loyalty from an employee.As with all the other stories in the series, the significant other seems to fall right into the life of Nemesis. The organization plays such a big part in their lives that the relationships wouldn't work otherwise. Because of this, these stories are not your typical historical romance with the relationships taking place at several society balls. If you are looking for that type of story, this book (and series) is not for you. But if you are looking for a historical romance with some adventure and mystery then this is the series for you.

It&#8217;s TNG&#8217;s chance to experience the &#8220;mirror universe&#8221; we got to see on-screen in both TOS and DS9, and, as I expected it to be, it was well written, with a few moments that really delighted me.One was the introduction of the dolphin, Hwiii, a hyperstring researcher who &#8216;swims&#8217; through the ship in a sort of water skin. Another was when Data, meeting Hwiii, tilts his head for a moment and then &#8216;speaks dolphin,&#8217; because, of course he does.I liked that Geordi and Deanna were the initial away team to the mirror Enterprise, and that they both got to use the knowledge they gleaned both from study and experience. Some of my favorite episodes were when Troi actually got to be a psychologist, and in this novel, she uses that training as much as she uses her innate empathetic abilities.Similarly, Geordi&#8217;s incredible depth of knowledge is highlighted in this book, as he works, sometimes with colleagues, and sometimes alone, to figure out a way to save, not just the ship, but the universe itself.I&#8217;m not sure when this was originally written but it felt like early TNG-fic. Data is very &#8216;sciency&#8217; but doesn&#8217;t have as much depth as he does in later novels &#8211; even in later pre-emotion-chip ones. It&#8217;s obviously before the contemporary push for continuity within the novels, but it&#8217;s still an entertaining read.Trek fiction is my crack.

There is so much raw emotion, and battle scars in this book I feel like I need therapy!  Sergeant First Class Reza Iaconelli, where to start&#8230; My heart broke for him. He was pure male power wrapped up in a lot of personal demons.  I seriously had to catch my breath a couple of times with him.  He is full of contradictions.  Physically he is all male. Big and physically strong.  Emotionally he is living one day to the next trying to function as best he can.  He tries to be the best Sergeant he can for his soldiers.  He is sympathetic to their insecurities yet battles with how to adequately prepare them for the realities of war and military life.  Reza is a recovering alcoholic, he struggles everyday with his addiction.  He is also surrounded by soldiers that have the same struggles.  Aside from struggling with alcoholism he is also dealing with PTSD.  Reza came with his own scars before joining the military and we learn about his home life and how it shaped him.Captain Emily Lindbergh is the opposite of Reza, although she struggles with her own personal issues, she comes from a life of privilege.  Her father was in the military but she never personally experienced the life of a soldier.  She is trying to bring help to soldiers such as Reza and his men, but not everyone thinks this is a good idea or is very welcoming to her.  Emily was a fantastic character.  She tried to show the soldiers her commitment to their mental health and was often the target of military personnel&#8217;s wrath.  Emily is alarmed at the high number of suicides and tries to provide the soldiers with some psychological support.As a couple Emily and Reza where exact opposites yet perfectly matched.  Where he is physically strong and emotionally weak Emily is physically weak but emotional very strong.  They had excellent chemistry and I loved that they formed a strong friendship.  I loved that they each met the other where they were at.  Emily never tried to &#8220;fix&#8221; Reza she accepted and gave him the support he needed although at times did not want.These characters were so real, Scott really peels back all their emotions and gives us two very vulnerable people.  When I read &#8220;Back to You&#8221; I felt the same way.  The characters were both so imperfect and so real.  Ms. Scott really captures the damage that soldiers experience during combat, after, and before.Honestly, this is a tough read.  I put the story down a couple of times, not because it was not well written or interesting, because it was all of those; but emotionally very challenging.  The characters were worth it.  It&#8217;s not a light read but it does provide a very &#8220;unromantic&#8221; look at the hardships of war and military life.  Overall, I think I can say that I recommend everything and anything written by Jessica Scott.  She really knows how to strip down her characters and show us who they are.  After the emotional odyssey it&#8217;s beautiful to see Reza and Emily find their way together!

It's got delicious sexual tension as well. She is very close to being a writer I would automatically buy. There are just a couple things about her writing style that bother me a bit, but it may not be an issue for anyone else. One is that she over-complicates the internal  conflicts to the point that it's a bit too much and a little convoluted. I don't think I've ever had this problem with a romance novel, since too much depth is not usually a problem, but I think she could pull back a bit on that and give more plot and external conflicts. There was never much standing in the way of their romance except their own issues, which were real and compelling but got to seem like they were over-done to sustain them through the book. And she piled them on, not so much heaping too many things so much as examining them in-depth and in excruciating detail, in many different ways over and over. This leads to my second issue, which is way too much interior dialogue, characters dissecting everything that happens when we've already get it. Much of this could have been cut out so there was a better balance of action and dialogue and the more interior writing.

I would rate the book 2.5 stars with a summary that the author has the beginnings of what could be an interesting series, but would caution that Creedor itself is an average stand alone novel that lacks a cohesive storyline.  In the first 20% of the novel we are introduced to characters and a plot that I assumed would be the basis for the rest of the book, but this is not the case.  After being introduced to Jarlord (obvious antagonist) and the wizard Vandalen (obvious protagonist), we move on to new characters and plots that end up taking shape and making some sense, but by that time the reader is at the end of the book.....which ends rather abruptly just as I felt like I was beginning to make sense of the story.I will admit that I am not normally an avid reader of fantasy or science fiction, so I was likely not as patient as I might otherwise be with what I considered a disjointed storyline that I had difficulty following at times.

This, since I have read a lot of books with similar story lines. However I was very wrong. Even though the big picture was alike other books it was so unlike anything I have read. I absolutely loved it and was constantly surprised. Never a dull moment and I was instantly caught in the story and did not want to go to work lol!Some parts of the story was making me so sad and where heartbreaking. It almost made me cry! Other parts had me laugh out loud.Charachters:Ellie Holbrook is the heroine in the book and I loved her. She has a very rough past littered with abuse, drugs and so on. When she finds herself pregnant she is forced to grow up and she excels at it. She is so mature for her age and is awesome with her daughter Sophie. She is confident and knows what she want. She does not joke around and when she knows what she wants she goes after it.Nicholas Grayson is the ultimate douchebag! I absolutely hated him in the beginning. His attitude sucked and I could not stand him. He did what he wanted just because he could. No caring at all if his actions harmed others. Bleh! Selfish bastard! That was until he met Ellie. She started out as a bet and eventually became so much more. Nicholas started to realize that the front he had put up was not going to work with Ellie and she made him want to be better.Romance:There was a lot of romance and it was hot and sizzling! A bigger rollercoster I would have to look for. Ellie and Nicholas love story has so many ups and downs that you almost get dizzy. But it totally works and thats what makes their love so awesome. The can be so perfect together and other times they are a total disaster waiting to happen. As the book so adequately is called their love really is a beautiful disaster :)Action:Not much action as in real fighting but there was a lot of other types of action in the story. It felt like it was Ellie and Nicky against everyone else all the time. A lot of other characters had their own agenda as to why they should not be together and had no limits of how far they would go to get it.Cover:Simple and lovely!

Epic!Awesomeness is not a good enough word to describe this brilliantly written story &#8211; No I think Epic would sum it up nicely.  This captivating story is filled with a humorous seductive romance that kept me glued to the pages and wanting to live in their world forever.  The author&#8217;s descriptive details of the Highlander&#8217;s country side and their clan&#8217;s leaves the reader with a breathtaking vision that will forever be melded into your heart.  The character&#8217;s chemistry and humorous banter will forever have you longing for more of their story.Edmund MacGregor is a man of his word and beliefs.  God-like example of David & Goliath, the metaphor is clearly a Highlander conquering and ending the Giants of Aristocratic Nobility&#8217;s political gains.  His presence bleeds sexuality with his stance and handsome features, but his voice and actions will melt your heart first with a wanting desire.Dedicated to his cause for love of country and keeping the English from signing a treaty that will unite Scotland under their rule, he can only come up with one solution and puts the plan in motion to keep the treaty from happening and that is to capture the niece of the Duke of Queensberry.  However, what he doesn&#8217;t anticipate is falling head over heels in love with his charming captive Miss Amelia Bell.  No his adventure turns into not only a win for Scotland but a fight for an unconditional sacrifice for love than to ever live without her.Amelia has got to be my favorite character of all time.  I absolutely loved her.  I never laughed so hard &#8211; I literally had tears coming out of my eyes with her accident prone actions.  She reminded me of &#8220;KANE - the demon of Disaster&#8221; from the series Lords of the Underworld where every time she touched something or went somewhere disaster followed her in a humorous way.Amelia truly captured my heart with her tender innocent demeanor.  She is one of those females that is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well.  Her loyalty and dedication to her family is unconditional but her love for true passion puts a few adventurous curves in her road to happiness especially when she meets her dreamy godlike &#8220;David of Goliath&#8221; Edmund.Tormented between having a life with a man of her dreams and with honoring her father&#8217;s wishes of an arranged marriage to Seafield - the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, a man she doesn&#8217;t love.  Amelia&#8217;s heart breaks knowing the sacrifice she must make in order to not ruin her father&#8217;s status among the English aristocrats.The story is full of adventure and lots of Highlander action making it a fast read.  The sweet and tender erotic romance had the perfect amount of teasing and playful love making scenes (3 Flames).  The happy ever after had me smiling and hugging the book with giddiness.I have to say that this is my first book by Paula Quinn and I am awed in amazement of how addictive her writing is.  The plot was perfect, the characters were brilliantly created, and the world building is one I could live in forever.

Berg.  This is Leah and Declan's story.  Both of whom were introduced in When You're Ready.  If you recall Leah is Clare's best friend and a nurse at the hospital where Logan, Clare's new husband works.  Declan is a famous movie star and one of Logan's college buddies.  Leah and Declan have a one night stand in book 1 and book 2 pretty much starts a few months later.I'm not going to rehash the entire book or reword the synopsis.  I am going to tell you right off the bat that overall I thought this was a decent story.  Was it as good as book 1?  In my opinion, no, and I hope to tell you why I did and didn't like it.I thought the characters in Never Been Ready were well developed.  We get lots of insight on both Declan and Leah's upbringing as well as who they are as adults.  We learn what makes them tick, what makes the love and what makes them laugh.  Declan and Leah together on the pages are hot and steamy as well as light and fun.  There are even some poignant moments.  Those poignant moments are what I think J.L. Berg is really good at writing.I loved all the moments with Clare and Logan.  I missed them and I was super happy to have them back.  I also appreciated the introduction of Clare's brother, Garrett.  There were many obvious moments in the book where Garrett was being set up for book 3 in the series, Ready For You.This is the tricky part for me.  How to explain what I didn't like.  The only word that keeps coming to mind is lackluster.The premise of the story was good.  Leah's childhood plays an important role.  Logan's childhood as well is integral.  The way their two lives ultimately intersect is also really important and was well thought out.  There was even a shocking moment that gave me goosebumps.  Goosebumps are always good!!  I just felt like the journey to get to the good stuff felt forced and quick.  For instance there is a certain scene between an actress and Leah at an awards show.  I felt like that particular moment had absolutely no bearing on the story as a whole.  The story wasn't really about Declan as an actor and whether or not Leah could handle it.  There was also a scene near the end involving Leah's father.  It may have been an attempt to tie up loose ends.  Maybe even an attempt to open Leah and Declan's eyes.  Again, I thought it was unnecessary.  The story would have been good without it.  I didn't think Leah needed that closure.  I didn't think Declan needed that push.I felt this story had a much deeper meaning than a hollywood actor who sweeps a woman from an abusive home, off on a whirlwind relationship.  It was about two people broken and bruised by their parents, being able to come together as a couple and finding their way towards a future with each other.  It was about embracing the future and accepting what's in front of you.  Accepting who you are, what you're capable of and what you can offer someone in return.  This was a story about love, forgiveness, and hope.For as many times as I rubbed my eyes and scratched my head in frustration, I was however, also rewarded with those special moments.  This is where I love J.L. Berg's writing, there is so much potential here.&#34;But that kiss?  That kiss left me awe-struck.  It was earth-shattering in its simplicity, mind-numbing in its intimacy, and completely raw in its emotional depths.&#34; - LeahSigh....see?  That's beautiful right there.  Give me more of that and less fluff.  It's okay to have lots of angst, inter-mingled with funny and lighthearted moments, while still being able to give us beautiful lines.  I don't mind the insights into each others worlds.  On the contrary those are important for character development.  It's the other stuff, like the moment with the actress, or the box that Declan takes from the attic of Leah's childhood home, that doesn't reappear again until nearly the end of the book.&#34;Shit.  I'm going to cry again.  Why do I cry so much around you?&#34;&#34;I don't know, but I'll hold you every time you do.&#34;I remember when I read that part I had to stop and smile at my husband because that's something he would say to me.  Those are the moments I like to look for my stories.  The stuff I can relate to or dream about or swoon over.  There is a really good story here in Never Been Ready, it just didn't come together for me as a complete package.Should you read this book?  Absolutely.  It might not be my favorite but it's still a decent read.

I would recommend Mead's book if for no other reason than it has inspired me to pick up &#34;Middlemarch&#34; and give it another try. Mead gives a believable interpretation of Dorothea's actions and motivation, as well as an analysis of each of the major characters. Yes, there are many of what we today call &#34;spoilers&#34; included in this examination of Mead's favorite book, so if you have not read &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; and wish to, be warned.In addition to discussing the characters and the story of &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; Mead looks at George Eliot's life as it mirrors the various aspects of the book -- youth and the desire and need to find one's place in the world; love and courtship; what constitutes a good marriage or a bad one; how to deal with an intimate relationship with another person; growing older, and eventually death. Mead's book has been called a memoir by some critics, because she does mention some pertinent parts of her own life, and some actual physical journeys made back to England to look at many of Eliot's haunts. However, Mead's life is only a very small part of this book -- most of it has to do with the life of the author of Mead's favorite book, the lovely and haunting writing style, the sly humor, and the pointed observations on the nature of mankind that came to fullest fruition in &#34;Middlemarch.&#34;I do understand an obsession with a particular book -- mine being &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; by John Galsworthy. I have read Galsworthy's masterpiece at least one in every decade since the 1960s (and sometimes more than once). As &#34;Middlemarch&#34; calls to Mead, &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; calls to me, and I find something new in it every time. Just as Eliot knew the heart of her characters, even the more unpleasant or unsympathetic ones, I found myself identifying with the same character (&#34;Soames Forsyte&#34;) as I became older. While Galsworthy was not happy that so many readers identified with Soames, Eliot seemed to understand and forgive the characters, such as Casaubon, who were less than perfect and who presented barriers to loving and being loved over and over.I think this book will appeal to many different sorts of readers -- those who share the author's love of Eliot and &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; those who appreciate a well-written book that examines an author's life and work, and those who want to pick up Eliot's masterpiece but have been afraid to do so for any one of a number of reasons. Good show, Ms Mead, good show.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Homage to a Favorite Book", "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014"}

Each chapter reads like that day's ramblings, not related to anything that's come before. Maybe he wrote this as therapy. Maybe he was bored by taking time off to rediscover his muse. (Btw, he found it. He recently played Carnegie Hall to some of his best reviews). Either way, this is Neil's mind, seemingly fully exposed. It's quirky, to say the least. And repetitious. This could have been cut in half. Still, you won't really mind because Neil really does have a lot to say, and much to recall of his storied career, which peaked by the early 70s. Yet, he's still creating great music, and his voice is still one of the wonders of rock. He is completely right in his crusade to upgrade the recorded music listening experience. Music did sound better before digital, and we have gone seriously backwards. He wants us to be able to feel music again. I hope the industry listens.

Delicious. . . absolutely delectable!As a child, Portia had a dream to run her grandmother&#8217;s restaurant (The Glass Kitchen) in Texas; however, after settling for a different life (married to a senator which betrayed her with her best friend, and did not allow her to use her cooking talents); a life derailed, she finds herself divorced, and moving to Manhattan to join her two sisters, Olivia and Cordelia.Portia is sure she was responsible for her grandmother&#8217;s untimely death and gives up her passion of cooking, due to this misconception. She inherited the ancestral gift (a knowing about events thru food), and her Gram instructed her how to use her abilities, leaving some helpful cookbooks and tips (how to heal certain illnesses with specific foods, among other things).Portia escapes Texas, and moves to the Upper West Side in a rundown brownstone townhome (garden lower level apartment), she inherits from her Great Aunt Evie, filled with fond childhood memories. However, she has no job skills and no divorce settlement (her first job was a hoot)! Her two sisters have sold their share of the townhome, to the handsome investment banker man who lives upstairs on the upper two floors (Gabriel Kane). The other two sisters are not without problems either.Gabriel lost his wife a year earlier, and is raising two daughters, Miranda (16) and Ariel (12, almost 13), and things are not going well in this household--total dysfunction and lack of communication. He wants to buy Portia&#8217;s garden apartment; however, she does not want to sell as this is the only thing she owns.The last thing Portia wants is to get involved with a man and his daughters. She has problems of her own &#8211; like how to survive in NYC! However, the minute she meets this man &#8211; her food thoughts come back strong, and no matter how much she tries to escape, the more she is pulled into this world of food, cooking, and lust.However, fate steps in and forces Portia to do what she loves best in life &#8211; COOKING, as a means to support herself &#8211; working for handsome and complex Gabriel, while planning her test kitchen with the two sisters, sending aromas to the streets of NYC, while seeking investors for their desired new restaurant (The Glass Kitchen)--if they can find the capital. Some good comfort Texas food, gourmet style in for fast pace NYC&#8212;putting her cooking skills to work to bring in the customers (and investors).Of course, to really make it yummy, nightly midnight visits (down the fire escape)to the garden level, from the complicated, hard nose, but sexy Gabriel, with some irresistible delights and surprises.All is not rosy and uncomplicated in this Upper West Side neighborhood. There are many twists, and obstacles along the way in this messy family of Kanes &#8211;from Gabriel&#8217;s mother, his brother Anthony, Gabriel&#8217;s former wife, and mother of the girls, with a secret past and events leading to her death, which shake Ariel&#8217;s world, as well as Portia.With quirky neighbors (Stanley and Marcus), supportive sisters, hot sex, some strong women, yummy gourmet recipes, love of food and recipes for life, with a young girl&#8217;s determination to put her family back together, to one&#8217;s woman&#8217;s courage and journey to fulfillment and passion &#8211; a meal you will want to savor!Linda Francis Lee created an irresistible banter and chemistry between Gabriel and Portia, which will keep you smiling and rooting for this sizzling, yet odd couple. And oh, Aerial will melt your heart, with her intelligence and winning personality, as she finds her way.There are many parallels here, and would be ideal for book clubs or discussions. Portia and Ariel, are very similar&#8212;both are youngest of sisters, guilt ridden, undervalued by others for their intelligence, keen sense of humor, talent, style, and passion &#8211;both courageous and determined to make things better, as they discover their true self.From the inviting front cover to the delectable and mouth-watering recipes &#8211; a captivating novel of love, forgiveness, family, courage, and the determination to follow your heart and dreams.I was traveling while reading this book, and had to get up extra early, in order to finish THE GLASS KITCHEN, this morning before getting back on the road. Could not wait to see what would happen to these unforgettable and lovable characters. A five star winner! Looking forward to reading more from this insightful and talented author.If you are a fan of contemporary fiction, chick lit, romance, humor, southern women&#8217;s fiction, love of gourmet food, and family dynamics, you will be assured to enjoy this magical novel, where life is not always perfect &#8211; as the fun is in the &#8220;messiness&#8221;, with some courses and recipes to sweeten the deal.Fans of authors Sarah Pekkanen, Emily Giffin, Mary Kay Andrews, Sarah Rayner, Jane Green, Sarah Addison Allen, Susan Rebecca White, Mary Ellen Taylor, Joanne Demaio, Beth Hoffman, Nancy Thayer, Wendy Wax, Mary Simes, or Dorothea Benton Frank will find THE GLASS KITCHEN, fresh, irresistible, funny, and quite satisfying.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Loved everything about THE GLASS KITCHEN!", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"}

It is essentially split up into two parts, so I&#8217;ll take it one at a time.Part 1:  The continuing battle with Uncle Aaron:While Miles and Aaron team up together at the beginning of the volume, they inevitably battle, as Aaron&#8217;s blackmailing of Miles is finally resolved.  Frankly, I was shocked by how it was resolved.I haven&#8217;t mentioned this in previous reviews, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say that I really like the fact that Miles&#8217; power set is different than Peter&#8217;s old power set.  Sure, there are some similarities, but then there are also some drastic differences.  The camouflage and venom blast are especially awesome.From here on out, there will be spoilers until I get to Part 2.  The death of Aaron was tragic and necessary.  As the Prowler, Aaron is a villain, and an enemy to Spider-Man.  The fact that he knows Miles&#8217; secret identity means that he couldn&#8217;t have stayed in the story unless he turned good.  Aaron wasn&#8217;t on that trajectory, so he had to die, for the sake of the story and the character.  But how he died, accidentally being killed by his nephew, is so tragic for Miles, who now has to live with this as a 13 year old.  In an interest parallel, the death of Uncle Ben influenced the way Peter Parker would live as Spider-Man, and I&#8217;m certain that the death of Uncle Aaron will impact the hero that Miles becomes.  Aaron&#8217;s dying words, &#8220;How about that?  You are just like me,&#8221; will surely haunt Miles for years.  He will now have to look his father in the eyes knowing that he is responsible for the death of his father&#8217;s brother.Part  2:  Working for Captain America:Although I&#8217;m not reading any other Ultimate Marvel books, it is clear that there is a storyline going on in which some sort of war has started.  Captain America is leading the good guys, and Miles joins by their side.  This section, called &#8220;Divided We Fall,&#8221; opens with the words, &#8220;Washington is decimated.  The government is a mess.  The Southwest is in chaos.  States are seceding from the union.  America is falling apart.&#8221;  This sets the stage for Miles going to war, but not before an opening scene where Miles&#8217; father tells him (Spoilers) the bad news that Spider-Man killed his uncle!Spoilers from here on out.  As with previous volumes, Peter&#8217;s cast appears in Miles&#8217; story.  In this volume, we get a crucial interaction as Aunt May and Gwen Stacy decide that it is time for Miles to have something that Peter built.  Web-shooters and the web formula!  I have to be honest, with all the other awesome powers that Miles had, I failed to realize that he didn&#8217;t have the ability to go web-swinging.  This will be even better now!  Since Miles&#8217; best friend, Ganke, is really smart, and knows his secret identity, he is tasked with the mission of creating the web fluid using Peter&#8217;s formula.Ultimate Maria Hill makes an appearance in this volume, and quickly realizes a connection between Spider-Man and Miles&#8217; family.Back in the war, chaos ensues, and Spider-Man is a big hero.  I really like it when Miles can work with Spider Woman (Peter&#8217;s clone, but in female form), this volume had a lot of that.  Plus, there was further character development with Miles&#8217; parents.  Another great Spider-Man book.I read this volume right after reading volumes 1 and 2, and it was a good experience to read the whole story (so far) straight through.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Spider-Man teams with the Ultimates as the United States are torn apart", "unixReviewTime": 1389830400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2014"}

Behind His Eyes - Truth is just another example of how Ms. Romig is at the top of her game and shows no signs of slowing down. Giving us Tony's POV is a huge treat, and helps us dive into the mind of this disturbingly, sexy, possessive man.In BHE - Truth, we are reminded, yet again, how powerful Anthony Rawlings really is. He is a man on a mission. He wants something he takes it. All throughout this story it's like you can hear him in your head, the anger, the desperation, everything this man feels, you are right there with him. Some might say we get so invested in this character, and we are so conflicted on how we feel about him, it can take a toll on us. I can certainly say, for a fact, that this series has taken a toll on me, in a bone-chilling, heart-racing, mind-****ing way, but I wouldn't have it any other way. These are the stories that stick with you long after you finish reading. It's what you start comparing all other books to. Nothing beats the raw emotion and intense feelings this series pulls out of you.Anthony Rawlings, Tony, Anton, Mr. Rawlings....no matter what you call this man, he will wreck you. He will make you hate him. He will make you feel sorry for him, and he will make you love him. This will go on and on, until you don't know what to think. No matter what you feel for him, the point is...you will FEEL.&#10077;She was his drug. Claire Nichols ran through his system like ecstasy, sending him on otherwise unobtainable highs.&#10078;In Behind His Eyes - Truth, Tony finally has to deal with circumstances beyond his control. That's not to say he won't try, but it's out of his reach. Conflicting feelings turn into clarity, and then to opportunity. Every little detail has it's reasoning. There are scenes that you appreciate getting a second look at. Maybe you will get some answers to some questions that have been on your mind. Maybe it will make you even more confused. No matter what, we get to see the two characters that we have fallen for happy again, even if for a moment in time. I'm pretty sure I said this in my last review of BHE - Consequences, but if you are an avid reader of this series, even though you know what's going to happen, it is still so **** intense!I could seriously go on and on about Tony. He is so incredibly fascinating. Some of you while reading this will have little smirks on your face at times. We get to witness Tony without control. He always has such an internal conflict when it comes to his Claire. The depth of his feelings for Claire is beautiful, yet a little scary, but it's nice to bare witness to such a gruff man come to terms with his love for another human being. For such a powerful man he has so many regrets. It's a little sick that I find some comfort in his suffering, but it reminds us that he is just a man.&#10077;He didn't want to be disappointed; however, more than that, he didn't want to disappoint.&#10078;So make sure you pour yourself a glass of wine, shot of tequila, or a whiskey sour, because this will take a lot out of you. Nobody can write intensity like Aleatha Romig. She is so high at the top of her game right now, I can't wait to get the final chapter in this saga.

I wish that there were more adult dystopian books but again this one is a Young Adult read. Not that I have anything against it but really someone needs to write an awesome Adult Dystopian novel!Divergent has been on my TBR (To be read) list for a long time and I was able to borrow this book from my friend finally and read it and I am so glad I finally was able to read this book! I am giving it 5 stars! Veronica Roth writes so well, there is no draggy parts at all, it has everything I could ask for. First of all, I think something that all dystopian books must have to be a good read is good action, during Tris&#8217;s Initation in Dauntless she does a lot of gutsy things, she jumps on to and off of trains, jumps off buildings, and climbs the ferris wheel at the old Navy Pier and that is just naming a few, I won&#8217;t tell you everything because I do not want to tell any spoilers. Roth also describes the landscape of Dystopian Chicago amazingly. I am obsessed with Chicago and have been there 3 times in the last 6 years to visit and the way she describes the places in Chicago and where Tris and her family and friends are at I can envision so clearly. There is also romance but not so much that it ruins the book and the meaning behind the book. Tris and Four are such a different couple then in most books I read and at the same time I can identify with them a little bit. I do not really have one bad thing to say about this book. If you like dystopian novels go out and try this one. I am looking forward to going with my co-blogger Colleen to see the movie so we can disect it and write a review of the book vs. the movie for everyone!Thanks always for reading!RochelleP.S.

I have been known to enjoy the serial books that are becoming a &#34;thing&#34; but, I think this book would have been better off sitting a little bit longer and coming out as a full story and not pieced out. I feel that the serials are meant for very emotional, and raw stories. Fix You didn't accomplish that with me. It felt disjointed and very rushed. I could not bring myself to like the heroine, Olivia, she seemed childish, and naive. Whereas, Bash has so much riding on his job, and seemed to be a stand up guy for his family until Olivia makes him lose his head. It just didn't click with me. The story, the characters, their circumstances and their chemistry. Something just seemed off.That being said, Fix You does have the potential to grow into a book I would like to read. It did end on a mild cliffhanger which will probably intrigue me enough to move on to the second book. But the second serial is going to have to possess major growth where Olivia is concerned, and more explanation where her family is concerned, and build more on Bash and Olivia's relationship. The way part one ended, it just felt like a physical connection with no deeper meaning between the two.Again, I don't mind serials but they have to be done fantastically. This one was just so-so, and the fact that it was a serial on top of that just made it more frustrating than anything. I want to be left needing and wanting more. Fix You just left me perplexed and wanting it to have gone the extra mile and reach its potential. I sincerely hope this was just a slow start and then next parts in the book will rise to the occasion.Happy Reading!*ARC provided by the author/publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I really wanted to like it...", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2014"}

I enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline that Grace provided for us.Pacing: I felt this one was really well paced. Landon and Skye's relationship progressed quite well given their situation and Grace did a good job of keeping the story going without too many lulls or too much filler.Storyline: I really enjoyed this one. I do love the whole forbidden office romance going on and I liked that this storyline seemed to fall into place a bit more naturally than the first book in the series did. The story begins with Skye getting out of a messy potentially abusive relationship and starting a new job. She meets Landon Steele at a club one night and while she's not looking for anything more right now, she can't help the physical response he elicits from her. And then runs away. It made me chuckle because it sounds like something I would do! Unbeknownst to her, Landon is actually her new boss, which brings things to a whole new level of awkward and tense. Both know it would not be professional to have any kind of relationship, but staying away from one another is going to prove to be quite the task. Having to work closely together, it's only a matter of time before Landon and Skye give in. There was one obstacle thrown in I could have done without, as I felt it was added in to create more drama, which was unnecessary. There was already a more concrete storyline in place to add tension, and I felt that was good enough.Characters: I liked Skye and Landon. Skye is sweet and a bit of a seductress! She isn't actively looking to start anything else after getting out of her previous relationship, but things with Landon just happen and that kind of chemistry is just hard to ignore. She is close to her father and she doesn't want to do anything that will jeopardize his career, which is why she shoulders some things later in the novel on her own, instead of seeking help. She cares for Landon and doesn't want her mess disrupting his business, as he's worked hard to get where he is today.Landon is a great male lead. He's sexy, sweet, and dominant all in one. And man, do I love my dirty-talking boys! Landon could be a bit hard to read at times, but he is really a good guy who cares for Skye. He knows they should keep it professional, but working so closely with her does nothing to help his libido. Landon is very protective of Skye and he can't stand that her ex, Vic, hurt her. He refuses to watch another woman get crushed under the weight of a man, after seeing what his father did to his mother. He was the one to pick up the pieces and therefore, cannot let himself forgive his dad, despite his pleadings to see him and make things right.We also get to see Ellie, Mason, and Katie from Rumor Has It show up. Ellie and Katie are those girlfriends every girl needs in their life and I like that Grace included their friendship.Final Thoughts: Overall, I thought Picture Perfect was a great read. I liked seeing Skye and Landon's relationship develop slowly, as well as watch them fight the attraction they feel towards one another. Their scenes together were sexy and I didn't feel they were too over the top at all. There were a couple of things I could have done without, because I didn't feel they were necessary to fueling the plot. The storyline really did stand on its own, with their relationship, Skye's ex, and the matter of how important public appearance is to both of them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline Grace provided for us.", "unixReviewTime": 1401753600, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2014"}

Refusing to repent and name the partner in her sin, Rachel feels the wrath of the religious sect as she is shunned by those she loves most. She is eventually coerced into leaving by her brother-in-law, the bishop.But secrets run deep in this cloistered community, and the bishop is hiding some of his own, threatening his conscience and his very soul. When the life of Rachel&#8217;s baby is at stake, however, choices must be made that will bring the darkness to light, forever changing the lives of those who call Copper Creek home.I was first drawn to this book by the cover.  I like reading novels about the Amish, as long as they aren't preachy, and from my experience they usually aren't.  However, this book was about Old Order Mennonites, which is a religion that I know very little about other then that they are similar to the Amish in their Plain ways.The Outcast is one of those rare novels that shines in many ways. I was immediately drawn in because &#8220;The Scarlet Letter&#8221; is such a favorite, and I was not disappointed. Every character, every sub-story, every generation, every relationship in the book, is layered and intricate and nuanced. The story seemed to start a little slow for me but once I was a few chapters in, I couldn't stop reading. Everything about the book took hold and wouldn&#8217;t let go&#8212;until I finished.  Even though the Mennonite community is completely foreign to me, Petersheim made it both fascinating but wholly accessible and familiar. In every scene I felt I was right there with her and every character.  Each word written had true meaning to the story.  There was very little that felt like filler.The story was written in two voices.  One was Amos who was Rachel&#8217;s sister's recently deceased father-in-law and the other was Rachel's voice herself.  Amos's voice served as an omniscient voice for both of his son's, Tobias and Judah, as well as the moral compass for the story.  His words were used as a commentary on the happenings of the book.  At first I was worried that using a &#34;ghost's voice&#34; was going to be distracting to the story, it turned out that his voice was truly the perfect compliment to Rachel's and a unique way to give voice to the brother's without devoting more chapters to each brother.  Petersheim's use of this device shows that she is going to continue to be a fantastic writer.  For an author to write in such a unique and difficult manner shows her writing maturity which will only grow the more that she writes.  One other complaint is that the book ended a little too quickly and I wish there was more information on how the book ending came to be and what happened to the family after everything finally settled down.  I would love to see a sequel to this novel because I was so wrapped up in the characters that I feel like they are real people to me.I highly recommend this book to others.  Give the book a chance and keep reading if you feel like the beginning is slow or confusing.  The author does a good job of sorting things out for the reader as the story goes on.  This would be a 5 stars book for me but I want to hold back a little because of the confusing beginning and the abrupt ending.  This is a solid 4.5 stars!

His panoramic and in-depth view of the people and the events made his Histories a comprehensive study that is rare in history. And he was a master storyteller too. The story he was telling here was the complex political disputes and long standing social feuds between Greek cities and Asian peoples that culminated in the Greco-Persian Wars.Of course any translated book is only as good as the translator and the editor. This happens to be an excellent one because neither the translator nor the editor tried to show off their classical Greek training or their convoluted scholarly skills. They simply presented this book in smooth and clear English which made the reading easy without the undue burden of constantly referring to the notes. In addition, the series of maps at the end of the book was immensely helpful.Traditional historians tend to take a serious and rigid position on their view of history as if it's the only perspective. Recently, some historians have tried to open up this narrow scope and try to interpret history from different points of view and have proclaimed their approach \"new history\". But Herodotus had beaten them to it because that's exactly what his Histories did.Even though he was writing for the Greeks, he showed great appreciation and understanding of Egyptian history and culture and often gave Egypt credit for many ideas and inventions later given to the Greeks. He also showed remarkable respect for their archenemy the Persians. In fact, a lot of our information of the early Achaemenids came from his writings. His open-mindedness and international outlook is astonishing. However, he couldn't resist giving Greek ancestors to the non-Greeks. Thus the Persians were descended from Perseus, the Medians from Medea, and the Egyptians from Io.Even though Herodotus lived in a city sponsored by Athens during the Peloponnesian Wars, he didn't seem to like the Athenians very much and praised the Spartans very generously. He tried to give dues and disclose warts when he talked about the conflicts between Greek city-states, personal vendettas among the leaders, reasons for frequent defections, and the wide spread collaborations between the Greeks and the Persians throughout this period. Not surprisingly, even though the Spartans helped the Athenians defeat the Persians in this round, two generations later, the Persians helped the Spartans defeat the Athenians.As this was a time before the fanatical intolerant monotheism took over the region and religious tolerance was the norm, Herodotus told the readers \"their Zeus is called XXX \" or \"their religious rite is similar to our XXX\" to relate foreign practices to Greek understanding. However, he wisely and steadfastly refused to engage in religious discussions beyond the necessary mentions of it as part of the cultural and political practice because he deemed it outside his chosen topics of history, geography, and culture.Some scholars complained that his writing was rambling but I find it very natural. He introduced each player when it was appropriate in the story and not before. He revealed each people, their history, their location, their customs, and their achievements as the flow of storytelling required.  By disclosing their origins and struggles, he gave roots to their unique culture and made their way of life reasonable and understandable. He was a master storyteller who knew when and how to take excursions and when and how to get back on track. With imperceptible forward momentum, he unrolled the story slowly and even-handedly towards its dramatic climax.Herodotus sprinkled a lot of traditional oriental wisdom, as dispensed by various wise men from different race, throughout the book. But it's often the small anecdotes which are most intriguing and lighten the reading. And some of the passing remarks are more than first meets the eyes. For example, his observation that the Egyptians had thick skulls because they shaved their heads and the Persians had thin skulls because they had long hair and wore felt hats is unexpectedly modern understanding of vitamin D from the sun thickens bones. And the bit about Xerxes' uncle explaining that dreams are not messages from gods but things we have been concerned about during the day is also surprisingly modern Jungian.Most impressively, he did not insist on his point of view. He shared other perspectives and other interpretations equally, even those information and stories he did not find credible. As he said \"I am obliged to record the things I am told but I am not required to believe them.\" He trusted the readers to make their own choice among various versions.  Some scholarly historians called this gossiping, but I thought it was respect for the readers. After all, there are many sides to every person, many facets to every event, and many explanations to every outcome.Even though the West has taken the position that the Greeks had won because of the naval victory at Salamis, it was not so simple. Considering that the Persians had demolished Attica and burned Athens, and considering that Xerxes returned home when winter was coming, one could conclude that the Persian's expedition to punish Athens for helping the Ionians and for burning Sardis was mission accomplished. Besides, Persia was never a sea power like the Greeks were anyway. So, win or lose, it all depends on the spin!On the other hand, Herodotus did have the advantage of living in a highly cultured and civilized world of Eastern Mediterranean and was writing for a sophisticated and educated readership.  Later scholarly historians didn't have his advantage because they were living in the Western Mediterranean world after the onset of the devastating Dark Age and after it was under the intolerant grip of Christianity. Besides, his gift for storytelling is unique even among fiction writers much less among historians.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Far Away and Long Ago Came Alive!", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}

Beautiful.Okay, now that I got that out of my system, let me just say that this was not what I was expecting AT ALL. The writing was beautiful. Lauren's inner monologues were beautifully written, although this girl annoyed me to no end. But I love characters who frustrate me. Isn't that the point? As the reader, I have the foresight/foreknowledge that Lauren doesn't so my frustrations with her weren't because she wasn't likable. I was frustrated because I was able to see the disaster coming (although, I COMPLETELY wasn't expecting it to be what it was) and she couldn't.I tried, but I just couldn't get myself to like Cal. Even after his whole secret was revealed, it didn't change how utterly repulsed I was by the way he treated Lauren. And then Lauren frustrated me further by defending him. By waiting for him. By putting her life on hold for him.She and Caylen deserve so much better. In the sequel, I really hope she and Chris get to know each other and fall for one another somehow, some way. I don't know why I feel that way since we didn't get to read much about Chris. I just do. Hopefully we'll have more insight into who he is in the next book.The suspense element of this story had me flipping pages and reading until the wee hours of the morning.

I had to see what would happen and what it would take for Mitch to come around and do right by Paige and his daughter.This book takes place approximately 7 months from the conclusion of the first novella. Believe it or not Mitch has not been home since he left and it takes a threatening document to stir him in to action.When back in town he wastes no time trying to establish a relationship with his daughter. Paige initially is shocked, then angered, then finds herself melting under the charms of Mitch. It is obvious the two still have feelings for each other.Both families have been very supportive of Paige and Bree. Everyone except Diane is leery of Mitch's actions regarding Paige. As one would guess the two find their way back to each other.I want to state that I love Kendall's writing and I was anxiously awaiting this book. Mitch does truly seem remorseful but I can't say I am happy with the ending. He screwed up in a major way, HUGE. I am ok with him trying to establish a relationship with Bree, but I cannot see how Paige gets past the abysmal way he treated her. Even when trying to work hard to get her back, the only thing that is conveyed crystal clear is his attraction and desire for Paige. Everything is very physical. His actions with Bree obviously are great but I don't see how he made any amends to Paige. Humbling himself with her family and Erin seemed inadequate and I really wish Paige sought something better.Then the crazy twist at the end, I knew something was fishy but I didn't have any clue it was gonna go down like it did. Not sure how I feel about that as it was thrown in last minute and not really dealt with. I am curious to read the next book however to see what happens between Josh and Erin.So overall, great writing, good story and characters which are believable.

I would recommend reading the other two books first since Pesh Nadeem appears in The Proposal, so the story makes more sense if you know his background. Megan McKenzie is a single mom who is in the final stages of becoming a registered nurse. She hasn't dated since her son's father left her when she found out she was pregnant. Pesh is an ER doctor who hasn't dated seriously since the death of his wife years ago. You would think they would want the same thing in a relationship...love and commitment, but you would be very wrong. Megan wants a hot fling, and Pesh wants to settle down and give love another try. They are both chosen as godparents to Aidan and Emma's son, Noah. Pesh is a great friend to them, and Megan is Aidan's niece. When they meet at the baptism, there is an immediate attraction between the two, but it's going to be a battle of the wills to see which one gets their way, a relationship or just hot, smoldering sex! Megan leaves the reception with Pesh after she has too much to drink, and she thinks she will be having a night of hot sex with the sexy doctor, but things don't turn out quite like she had hoped. The two go their separate ways the next morning, but fate isn't through with these two, Megan is assigned to Pesh's ER to finish her final clinicals several months later. Let the games begin again...you'll have to read on to see if Megan or Pesh win.I have read the other two books in the series and loved them. I know reading reviews from other readers that many of them didn't like Pesh in The Proposal because they thought he was trying to take Emma away from Aidan. However, I have always been a fan of Pesh's. Who wouldn't be! He's sexy as hell, a successful doctor, a truly honorable soul, and again did I mention sexy as hell? He falls for Megan hard the first time he sees her and cannot forget about her. Megan is a firecracker. If you read any of the other books, you know she takes after her Uncle Aidan. She and Pesh are truly opposites who complement each other nicely. Megan brings out the spontaneous side of Pesh, and he brings out the softer side of her. There are many scenes that include Megan's toddler son, Mason. Those were some of the most heart-warming scenes to me, especially the one near the end of the book when they are eating dinner with Megan's family. Much of the story is about Pesh's pursuit of Megan and trying to get her to give him a chance at a real relationship. The sexy stuff doesn't happen until at least mid-way through the book, but it was well worth the wait. Katie knows how to write a sexy love scene!One of my favorite things about this book is that I got to see how Aidan, Emma, and many of the other characters are doing.

They rushed to his beside when they found out he was in a coma, brought in some phenomenal specialist doctor to work with him, then just peaced out and were never heard from again. Emma didn't bother to inform him that they had been there, nor did he bother to ask, and also, nobody bothered to even freakin' tell them that he was awake and at home, and his parents didn't even bother to so much as call to check on him either!!4) Emma was harboring so much hurt & resentment towards William through most of the book, and then *BAM* like the flip of a switch she's.over.it.and.they're.getting.married.THE.END there was no actual working through her hurt, no communication, openness, honesty. So now they got their &#34;HEA&#34; that seems doomed because their whole relationship is based on lies & deceit between 2 people who are trying too hard to be what they think that the other wants, rather than being who they really are.With all that being said, the series was good, and had TONS of potential for greatness, but the last 2 books were just too rushed and had too many holes in the plot.Also, I would have very much preferred to read the 2 books together, just written as 1 book, done in alternating POV's.Wow, that was really long winded, if you've stuck it out and are still reading this, thank you!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "SO.MUCH.POTENTIAL!", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2014"}

What will come of all the friendships? What will happen to Mira and Danny's relationship?  Will these four people find their happiness?&#34;...You have no idea how much I love you. You're my moon, my stars, and my universe...&#34;Ashley Suzanne had me with Mirage. I fell in love with a story and a group of incredible characters.  I was left on the edge of my seat wanting to know what will happen next. And as much as I want to know , I'm happy she took the time to give us Danny's POV.  You learn a lot more about Danny and Mira's relationship in this novella.  But you also get an understanding of how close Mira and Skylar become as well. I can not wait to read Awakening and see what happens next with these four amazing characters.

We can be fluid, flexible when we have to be. But strong and destructive too. And something else, I think to myself. Like water, we mostly follow the path of least resistance.&#8221;Seeing as Wally Lamb is my favorite author I was extra excited to read this book. It definitely did not disappoint. On the surface, this is a story of a broken marriage. Of a wife and mother of three who leaves her husband for another woman. If you have read some of his previous works, you already know that there is going to be so much more to the story. Pour yourself a large glass of red wine and keep the bottle nearbyThere are so many heavy issues that are dealt with in this story, divorce, sexual abuse, loss of a parent, alcoholism, the list goes on. I know this makes it sound like a depressing story but it&#8217;s not all bad. The real heart of the story is learning to cope with what life has given you and making the most of it. Buy another bottle of wine.The thing I love the most about his novels is the way everything is so layered. You have to pay attention to things that may seem insignificant at the time as it will certainly come full circle in the end. There is always some intertwined story that seems to not have anything to do with the rest until the end. This is not to say that everything gets tied up and placed in a nice package with a bow on it. Many things are just inferred and if you haven&#8217;t been paying attention you will miss out on these gifts.Annie Oh is an artist, a mother, and an ex wife and is about to be remarried. To a woman. Her husband Orion is left to deal with not only being left but being left for another woman. Their children are also forced to deal with aftermath of her decisions. Annie also has secrets from her childhood that have shaped everything she has ever done in her adult life. Things she has never shared with anyone. Not even her husband or her soon to be wife. Of course this only begins to scratch the surface of the entire plot of the story.This novel reminds me of the concept of the butterfly effect. One small action effects so many things. It is not until the end that we learn what started everything. I can honestly say there is not one thing I disliked about this story.

Many of the ingredients in recipes were also other recipes from the book, so for instance a chicken recipe may have 12 ingredients, one of which is bacon aioli which is 8 ingredients and another is cauliflower rice which is time consuming as well.I also wasn't crazy about the type of recipes.

Its a romance, and also a puzzle with danger coming to Kate along with the solution.I liked Kate, she's mum to her dead sister's child, and she and Jamie have carved out a contented life for themselves. Then their world is turned upside down when tabloid papers print a story over Jamie being local hero and rugby player Lane's son. Of course as always they're not interested in the truth &#8211; just want scandal for the ratings. Kate is bombarded with Press at her home, Lane completely blind sided by the fact he may have a ten year old child, and Jamie struggling with insecurity wondering if he'll be taken from Kate...Kate's firm and insistent, nothing will take him away from her, though she's willing to let Lane build a relationship with him.Along the journey to the truth there's  a potential kidnapping, danger and attacks on Kate&#8217;s home and business, and threats to her safety. Lane steps up his protection of her and gradually falls in love. He just needs to persuade Jamie and Kate that they should be a family.Its a fun romance with a snippet of danger, not heart stopping but a more subtle kind that creeps up quietly and lands with a bang. The police were great characters too, becoming regular visitors.

The first of which is the fact that the author, Magdalen Nabb, passed away in 2007 and it is an opportunity to continue having her work presented to a new legion of readers.The second reason is the recent revival in this true crime cold case that has brought about a non-fiction novel (with the same title) that was co-written by Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi.  That book has garnered interest from Hollywood and a film is speculated to be made starring George Clooney in the role of Doug Preston!The Monster Of Florence was the Jack the Ripper of Italy having been charged with seven double homicides between 1968 and 1985. There were many other murders that could have possibly been committed by this individual but local law enforcement has been unable to prove any of that.  Actually, they have not been able to prove anything and this remains the most infamous cold case in Italian history.Along comes Magdalen Nabb attempting to put a fictional spin on this case.  Her recurring crime series that featured Marshal Guarnaccia is the perfect outlet for a speculative novel about the famed Monster of Florence.  Like the actual officials following this case, Guarnaccia seems to be foiled at every turn and is surprised when his Director assigns him the task of reopening an old cold case such as this one.The novel contains many court transcripts and internal communications that reviewed the various suspects in this case --- and there are a lot of them.  Nabb blends both fictional and non-fictional suspects to present a case for Guarnaccia that appears overwhelming for anyone to solve.If readers have read the non-fiction novel by Preston & Spezi they will realize how inept, corrupt and misguided the Italian law enforcement and legal communities were in regards to this case.  Preston and Spezi themselves were even detained and briefly accused of being the Monster themselves!  A frustrating endeavor for anyone seeking to bring clarity and understanding to this case.THE MONSTER OF FLORENCE provides a lot of technical detail that at times bogs down the action and pace of the novel.  The main enjoyment in reading a novel like this rests in having an understanding of the actual case it was based on and appreciating the attempt to shine some light on a dark chapter in Italian history.Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fictional take on an infamous Italian cold case.", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014"}

It's wonderfully illustrated, there's enough colour and pictures interspersed throughout to appeal to younger ages, but not to the point of being extremely juvenile so it can grow with them. This is a full version of the Bible, in the New International Readers Version (NIrV) which is a translation that uses contemporary english. I find it similar to the NIV.This Bible is hardcover, which is a big plus for durability. We have had one or two other Junior Bibles around here and the soft cover ones do not stand up well to regular use and going back and forth to church. The pages aren't super thin, I don't think they'll be likely to rip and the print doesn't leak right through making it hard to read. That seems to be a problem with some other children's Bibles because they are trying to do things cheap. Not a problem here. The only negative I have about this particular Bible is the lenticular picture on the front of the bible, the ribbed 3D kind of thing. I think it makes it look younger than it's really geared for and the age that would be ready for a full Bible. Besides that, young boys love scratching their nails across it!Overall, this is a great Bible choice for a boy or girl who is ready for a full Bible instead of a Bible story book. It's already got my 7 year old reading bits and pieces in his new Bible instead of feeling like it's way out of his league.

BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS is a departure from Harper&#8217;s normal vampires, werewolves, and witches, but it doesn&#8217;t suffer for it. In fact, this standalone was  a treat, and definitely worth the read despite my complaints about tropes.There were some truly creepy moments in BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS. Between the ghostly experiences, plus the &#8220;trapped on an island&#8221; plotline, there&#8217;s almost a horror movie feel in the background. I appreciated that the ghosts were scary, because the last paranormal romance with ghosts I read, the ghost was the heroine, and it just doesn&#8217;t seem right. Creepy ghosts are much more like it.My one complaint was the real-life bad guy. I think the book could have done without that addition, since there was already enough tension with the ghost story and trying to figure that out. Plus, the story was unique, and the addition of the stalker ex-boyfriend made it feel, at times, a little formulaic. I could easily see this novel without the ghosts being a standalone contemporary romance novel, so anything that made it feel more that way was a downside, in my opinion.All in all, BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS was classic Molly Harper, with laughs and romance and just enough paranormal to round it out. While it isn&#8217;t my favorite Harper, it definitely stands on its own merit, and since it isn&#8217;t a series, there really isn&#8217;t much investment required (though I wouldn&#8217;t mind a book about some of the other characters&#8230;).I would recommend it to anybody looking for a fun, creative romance read.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Standard romance tropes make this not the best Harper, but fun nonetheless", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"}

She has a murder to solve and somehow the past all comes together. The answer to the present is in the past.Now at times I got confused because the author would use the last names of the officers and prosecutor. I don't like being confused in a story hence the 4 star rating.Rebecka has to deal with a young and upcoming prosecutor who wants to push her off the case. But Rebecka takes it all into her own hands but what price does she pay?With this murder happening, Rebecka takes a look back at the family's past and notices more &#34;accidents&#34; have happened.Along with this book taking place in the present we are also taken back into the 1900's where all this pretty much started.

The book begins with Meg Elginbrodde and Geoffrey Levett in a taxi.  Levett is a wealthy businessman, used to getting what he wants and he is desperately in love with Meg and intends to marry her.  The problem is that since their engagement was announced, Meg has been receiving photographs from her husband - who she believed had died in the war.  She has turned to Campion and Detective Chief Inspector Charles Luke for advice, when a meeting is proposed between her and her former husband. The man she glimpses across the fog bound platform of a station is certainly not her husband, but the mystery deepens after he is questioned and released.What follows is an extremely atmospheric mystery;  set in a post-war, weary London in a middle of a pea souper fog.  As events escalate, Levett goes missing and witnesses are killed.  A convict called Jack Havoc has escaped from prison &#8211; he is hunting a &#8220;treasure&#8221;, while Luke and Campion search for him in the &#8220;Smoke,&#8221; which is the fog bound city of London.  There are some wonderful characters, such as the saintly Canon Avril, the brilliantly named Tiddy Doll and the elusive Havoc himself &#8211; the Tiger of the story.I had only read one Campion novel before and I found myself a little lost so far into the series, as obviously you were meant to know some familiar characters.  However, Campion himself did not feature strongly in the book, meaning that it worked quite well as a stand-alone story.  London itself &#8211; battered, weary, down at heel &#8211; is almost a character in itself.  Everyone stumbles around, unable to see and events are revealed slowly, almost as glimpses through the fog.  If you are interested in London shortly after the war, then this novel gives you a great view of the City at that time and is worth reading just for the historical aspect of the book.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Tiger in the Smoke", "unixReviewTime": 1399766400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2014"}

The Heroine, Charli, is likeable, feisty and challenging.  Thed Hero, Grant.....well....what can I say......a great Dom.  I could not wait to read Grant's story.  His appearances in the other two books had me wanting to read about THE man....the owner of the club.  Owners of a BDSM club is always my favorite Doms.  Once again, this book actually had an interesting storyline that went with the book well and not page after page of BDSM sex.  Don't get me wrong, I like erotic books but some books like Fifty Shades was way over the top in sex scenes which became page turners.  It is a very romantic book and when you finally hear all of Grant's story, you are pulled into his sadness because his love, his wife, his mate, was so great.  You also felt sorry for Charli because she loved him so much but would not settle for nothing less than a true relationship.  Now....what I did not like in this book is that the BDSM scenes seemed a little bit more darker than what I am use to.  Usually, it is someone else in the club who is receiving the beatings and the two main characters observe.  Not this book and she gets beaten hard.....not spanked with the hand (but that happens too by someone else because Grant is sharing????)  I do not care for where the Sub gets beaten so hard that she cannot lie on her back because it is so sore.  I guess I am old school and I am not into being shared.  If I am a Sub, I sub for only one person and that would go on the List.  Of course, in this book, that is somehow forgotten.  I also do not care for two guys on one girl at the same time and it seems to happen in the &#34;A Loving on the Edge Novels.&#34;  I am just not into that and I cannot see a person who is new at this sort of life would like it either.  My feathers get sort of ruffled when the beatings over something so minor occurs.  This feminist does not care for that, and I cringe when the scene is played out.  Of course, the writer happens to write that the Sub is a feminist but somehow she puts her feelings aside when being dealt with when she has done something wrong, which to me, is such a small thing.  I have no problems with bondage, the scenes, the displaying of the Sub in a scene for all to see, but it is really hard to get past the beatings.  That is something too dark for me.  I prefer Doms who are not into that sort of thing as well.  But all in all, I did give this book five stars because I love how Mrs. Loren writes, and I did not want to give it four stars simply because I shy away from beatings and it seems that others like it.  She makes her Doms very appealing and one cannot help but like her Subs.  As I stated earlier, I love owners of BDSM clubs.  They are the most interesting and the erotic scenes are fantastic.  Do I recommend this book, you bet.  Just be prepared for the more darker side of BDSM.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "There is not much to not like in this book", "unixReviewTime": 1401408000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2014"}

But when Ashling and her mother get there they learn that he intends to marry her off, even though she is only 14.  Ashling and her mother protest, but it is Ashling's brother who persuades their father to let Ashling wait a few more years before she is to be married to her intended.  A few years pass and Ashling and her mother are found by their pack's enemy.  They run back to her father for protection and it's decided that Ashling should go into hiding with Baran, a sort of lone wolf.  While living with him she meets Grey.  He's not a werewolf but there is something about him that she can't put her finger on, plus she is very interested in him.  Grey reciprocates the attraction, but many obstacles stand in the way of their happy ever after.This story started out great and kept me interested.  It's definitely unique compared to other werewolf stories I've read.  I was a little turned off that Ashling was only 14 at first; I thought I was going to have to read about a 14 year old, but then in the next chapter, a few years pass, so that was good news for me.Ashling is a headstrong female.  She doesn't let anyone, including her father tie her down.  Basically, she does what she wants.  She had great character traits, but I still had a little trouble feeling connected to her.Let's talk about chemistry between Ashling and Grey.  I could tell the attraction was immediate; but for the rest of their relationship I just felt like something was missing.  I can't put my finger on it though.  I honestly didn't care if they were together or not.  I didn't feel the love as much as they were saying it to each other.The story kept me very interested in the beginning, then I did get a little bored towards the middle, but the ending picked up again and I really couldn't put it down.  All in all, Bloodmark was a good book.  And the bonus is that it's the first book of a series.

Hagan, Jr. I&#8217;m a fan of the 1997 movie about the ill-fated ship and I&#8217;ve seen the movie many times. Because of that, I was immediately drawn to the book&#8217;s title. After I finished reading Hagan&#8217;s book, I can easily say that the author delivers on his promise to motivate, challenge, and empower his readers. He made an excellent choice for a topic. The book&#8217;s cover art alone is intriguing. Even though I&#8217;ve read some other books about the Titanic, I learned some new information here that I didn&#8217;t know. The author has obviously done his homework.I LOVED the poem from Dr. Benjamin Mayes that is on the back cover. I&#8217;d never read that before. There&#8217;s an important lesson in those rhymes that all of us can benefit from. I think it was very appropriate to feature it in this book.The author poses many thought-provoking questions. For instance, if you were among the over fifteen-hundred passengers on that ocean liner and you knew the end of your life was at hand, would you have lived your life differently?  Whoa, reality check! Our lives can be over in the blink of an eye. We get so tied up and self-absorbed at times that we can miss some of the warning signs of danger ahead. Sometimes it takes a Titanic-sized event in our own lives for us to pay attention to what&#8217;s really going on around us.  Perfect peace can only be found through God alone and His gift is there for all of us.  That some choose to reject or ignore the gift is one of the consequences of sin in a fallen world.The writing is good and the book is easy to read. I liked the format a lot &#8211; references at the bottom, fascinating trivia, historical facts, effective use of bold type, historical drawings and photos.  Most importantly, the scriptures the author chose to accompany his work are right on point in my opinion. The lesson titles are aptly named and I appreciated his modern-day parallels. There were a few minor grammar issues, but I didn&#8217;t see anything huge. There was also one confusing sentence for me with some awkward wording. Other than that, I was engaged and eager to read the whole book.There are so many takeaways. One of my favorite lines: &#8220;That we need to be grateful for every moment that we spend on earth.&#8221; Amen to that! I think this book would appeal to a vast audience, Christians and also Non-Christians looking for perspective on the trials of life.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Done", "unixReviewTime": 1401667200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2014"}

Instead of the usual ultra-brave heroine and hero fighting against the evil Nazis in any way they can; we have Beth, a Quaker pacifist, and Josef, a doctor in the German army who happens to believe in the Germany he remembers from childhood.After reading several WWII fiction books that mostly center in the U.S., England, or France, it was nice to read a slightly different view of things in Germany and of the many German's that fought against Hitler's regime in a myriad of ways.One of the fascinating things about the book is all of the Quaker beliefs and methods that are key to the story and how certain characters act. I knew almost nothing about the Society Of Friends, they are a little-written-about group, and so the fact that this story centers around a Quaker girl and some of her family and friends made this story even more interesting for me.The author does an excellent job of immersing the reader in WWII era Munich. I could see everything so clearly in my mind's eye. I felt like I was walking the streets of the city with Beth and Josef, stepping inside the apartment with Uncle Franz and Aunt Ilse, hiding in the basement from falling bombs with Liesl.The last third of the book did seem a bit hurried to me, causing the historical detail and character emotions to take a little dip.That aside, All God's Children was very enjoyable and I will definitely be looking forward to the release of the next book in this series, Simple Faith.The combination of setting the story in a  little used WWII location, the Quaker pacifism, (old) German patriotism, detail in locations, interesting characters, and just the history, make this a great book for lovers of Historical fiction.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher through The Book Club Network in exchange for my honest review.

This autobiography is revealing as she shows her ribald side, and addresses her fatal attraction to her famous husband Jack Cassidy and her unlikely but successful  marriage to Marty Engels.When you think Shirley Jones, you think pretty, pleasant, warm, calm, talented.  She wants to add another dimension to that image, and makes some odd choices in what she writes about, the most talked-about being her obsession with sex, and that mars the book.

No hesitation. I love that True was more than it seems from the description, that it wasn't simply the story of the bad boy and the virgin. It wasn't a sexual awakening or frivolous at all. True is a love story, pure and simple, of a two people who are near opposites, but fit together so very perfectly.Tyler and Rory were not one-dimensional characters, defined by the sexuality or social standing. They both held many layers, and that complexity really bonded me to both. Tyler grew up in such turmoil, and works so hard to keep his brothers together. He wants more out of life, but doesn't know that he'll ever get it. Tyler has a tough exterior, but is vulnerable with Rory. He's cocky, yet not really conceited. He was brave, yet scared to give his heart to a woman whom he deems too good for him. I loved that he loved Rory exactly as she was.Though I couldn't find any of myself in Rory, I connected with her deeply. I would say that is testament to McCarthy's ability to bring these characters off the page, make me love them. Rory was...she was just Rory. Logical to a fault, quiet and unassuming, always withholding herself and her emotions. I loved who Rory became with Tyler. That she wasn't afraid to push him, question him, and love him. Once Rory decided to open up to Tyler, it was like she became a better version of herself. She was still way literal, but she also joked more. Hugged more, allowed people to truly know her.Oh gosh, I sound like a sap. And I am one when it comes to books such as this. I think what I love about this series is that it is just so real. The characters don't come packaged with the right words or decisions, they mess up and they grovel and they learn and grow. That sort of experience is what I love so much about reading.There was a moment in True that struck me hard, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. It's when Tyler and Rory are discussing Streetcar Named Desire, and Rory just can't understand why these characters are behaving so illogically...&#34;If they would just communicate with each other, they could resolve all their issues in ten minutes.&#34;&#34;That's what makes the book so realistic,&#34; he told me dryly. &#34;Real people don't discuss this shit with each other.&#34;He had a point. I didn't really discuss my emotions with anyone either. I had spent most of my life being a silent observer. &#34;Oh.&#34;In one fell swoop, I got it. Literature wasn't intended to be about perfect people, it was about flaws, very real and very deep human flaws.That is an excellent reminder, I think.If you're looking for a deep, intense, sexy and fun New Adult series, True Believers is, without a doubt, one of my favorites.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm a Believer", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}

While she knows there has been destruction of personal items or the items have been stolen, Charlotte has promised her father she will again try to raise the rice crop and live on the land.The paragraph above states the setting of the fictional tale that is actually based on a real historical figure named Elizabeth Waties Allston Pringle.  Can you imagine what this woman witnessed in her lifetime?  How about thinking of what her life was like before and after the Civil War?  Charlotte is based loosely on the real life experiences of Elizabeth, and the author, with some minor adaptations, places her novel near where the real plantation where Elizabeth lived.  After you read the fictional tale, the author shares how she came to learn about this unique woman and her life.There are characters that portray what southern people must have felt during Reconstruction along with what many veterans suffered during a horrific war.  They had to learn to live in a new society that was still forming.  With so few eligible men to marry, we see a jealous female antagonist see that she indeed ends up with the one man she sets her eyes on no matter who gets hurt in reaching her goal.  Yellow fever is an epidemic that costs many lives in New Orleans in 1868.  With the destruction so complete, few can prove they own the land on which they return to.Dorothy Love writes a moving masterpiece that keeps the reader reading until they see how the unknown ending is revealed.  I simply cannot express how much the real woman Elizabeth, along with others who lived in the south before, during and after the war, had to learn how to start all over.  Readers see how a woman who has her faith shredded by heartbreak learns to trust God again in a time when each day brings new trials, triumphs or tragedy.  What a tenacity people displayed to endure and then to thrive each day.  Perhaps like our female lead character they did so by looking to God and putting one foot in front of the other time and time again.
